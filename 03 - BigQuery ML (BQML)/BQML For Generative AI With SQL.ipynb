    "# BigQuery ML (BQML) - Generative AI With SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "BigQuery is a the home for data.  It's native language is SQL.  You can also interact with it through a Pandas like API called BigFrames.  One of the best parts about BigQuery is the vast number of functions and capabilities that allow you to do workflows directly in BigQuery without ever exporting the data out.  Like Generative AI!\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow shows how to reference [Vertex AI hosted foundation models](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/learn/models) through the [ML.GENERATE_TEXT function](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/generate-text).  It will cover the setup and usage for multiple use cases as examples for getting started in your own environment.\n",

    "**BigQuery ML (BQML) Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "[BigQuery ML](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/bqml-introduction) allows you to use `SQL` to constuct an ML workflow.  This is a great leap in productivity and flexibility when the data source is [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/introduction) and users are already familiar with `SQL`. Using just `SQL`, [multiple techniques](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/bqml-introduction#model_selection_guide) can be used for model training and even include [hyperparameter tuning](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/hp-tuning-overview).  It includes serverless [training, evaluation, and inference](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/e2e-journey) techniques for supervised, unsupervised, time series methods, even recommendation engines.  [Predictions](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/inference-overview) can be served directly in BigQuery which also include explainability measures. Predictive models can be [exported to their native framework](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-export-model) for portability, or even directly [registered to Vertex AI model registry](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/create_vertex) for online predictions on Vertex AI Endpoints.  You can [import models into BigQuery ML](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/inference-overview#inference_using_imported_models) from many common frameworks, or [connect to remotely hosted models](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/inference-overview#inference_using_remote_models) on Vertex AI Endpoints. You can even directly use many [pre-trained models](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/inference-overview#pretrained-models) in Vertex AI Like Cloud Vision API, Cloud Natural Language API, Cloud Translate API, and Generative AI with Vertex AI hosted LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A great starting point for seeing the scope of available methods is the [user journey for models](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/e2e-journey).  This repository also has a series of notebook based workflows for many BigQuery ML methods that can be reviewed here: [../03 - BigQuery ML (BQML)](../03%20-%20BigQuery%20ML%20(BQML)/readme.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "**BigFrames Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "A new way to interact with BigQuery and BigQuery ML is [BigQuery DataFrames](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/bigframes/latest).  A new Pythonic DataFrame with modules for BigQuery (`bigframes.pandas`) that is pandas-compatible and BigQuery ML (`bigframes.ml`) that is scikit-learn like.  This series of notebooks will be expanded to offer workflow examples in the choice of SQL or BigFrames!"
