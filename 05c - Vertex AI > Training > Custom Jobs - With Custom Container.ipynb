    "# 05c - Vertex AI > Training > Custom Jobs - With Custom Container\n",
    "\n",
    "### 05 Series Overview\n",
    "Where a model gets trained is where it consumes computing resources.  With Vertex AI, you have choices for configuring the computing resources available at training.  This notebook is an example of an execution environment.  When it was set up there were choices for machine type and accelerators (GPUs).  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the `05` notebook, the model training happened directly in the notebook.  The models were then imported to Vertex AI and deployed to an endpoint for online predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this `05a-05h` series of demonstrations, the same model is trained using managed computing resources in Vertex AI as custom training jobs.  These jobs will be demonstrated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Custom Job from a python script (`05a`), python source distribution (`05b`), and custom container (`05c`)\n",
    "-  Training Pipeline that trains and saves models from a python script (`05d`), python source distribution (`05e`), and custom container (`05f`)\n",
    "-  Hyperparameter Tuning Jobs from a python source distribution (`05g` and `05h`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### This Notebook (`05c`): An extension of `05b` that saves the Python script in a custom container. \n",
    "This notebook trains the same Tensorflow Keras model from `05` by first modifying and saving the training code as a Python module on a custom container.  While this example fits nicely in a single script, larger examples will benefit from the flexibility offered by source distributions or module storage and this notebook gives an example of making the shift.   The custom container approach will also offer faster startup times and more flexbility in parts like frequency of updates, choice of frame works, and distributed training options.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The source distribution is then used as an input for a Vertex AI > Training > Training Pipeline that is also assigned compute resources and a [pre-built container for custom training](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/training/pre-built-containers) for executing the training in a managed service.  This is done with the [Vertex AI Python SDK](https://googleapis.dev/python/aiplatform/latest/aiplatform.html#) using the class [`aiplatform.CustomPythonPackageTrainingJob()`](https://googleapis.dev/python/aiplatform/latest/aiplatform.html#google.cloud.aiplatform.CustomPythonPackageTrainingJob).\n",
    "\n",
    "The client used here is `aiplatform.CustomPythonPackageTrainingJob(python_package_gcs_uri=)` which is very similar to what was used for the source distribution in `05b` `aiplatform.CustomJob()`. The functional difference is that this method automatically uploads the final saved model to Vertex AI > Models.  Running the job this way first triggers a job in Vertex AI > Training > Training Pipeline.  This Training Pipeline triggers a Custom Job in Vertex AI > Training > Custom Jobs.  If The Custom Job completes successfully then the final saved model is registered in Vertex AI > Models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The training can be reviewed with Vertex AI's managed Tensorboard under Vertex AI > Experiments > Experiments, or by clicking on the `05c...` custom job under Vertex AI > Training > Custom Jobs and then clicking the 'Open Tensorboard' link. \n",
