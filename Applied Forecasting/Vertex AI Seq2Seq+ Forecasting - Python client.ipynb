    "[This series](./readme.md) explores forecasting with Vertex AI, BigQuery ML, and additional open source frameworks.  Forecasting consist of following a measurement over time and exploring trends, the impact of seasonality (years, months, days, etc), holidays, and special events with the hope of using these insights to forecast into the near future.  Some method also incoporate observable measurements that impact demand to understand the relationships and make forecasting more accurate.\n",

The bike stations near central park will be selected and the daily number bike trips that orignate from these stations will be followed over time.  This will illustrate some common forecasting issues due to new stations being introduced over time and some stations only have the most recent few months, or just weeks of data.
