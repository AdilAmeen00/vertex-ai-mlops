# MLOps

Let's talk about MLOps!

## ML Code

This is where it all begins.  Hands find keyboard and start writing instructions to:
- find data source
- read data
- explore data
- prepare data
- process data into features
- build a training routine: language (R, Python) with a package or framework (XGBoost, TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, ...)
- iterate, iterate, iterate, ...
- evaluate the model
- iterate, iterate, iterare, ...
- prepare model for deployment - batch, online, cloud, onprem, mobile, ....
- monitor shift and drift
- troubleshoot everything that goes wrong or does not make sense
- automate
- repeat
- a MILLION other things!

This starts with a user in a tool of choice.  An IDE for developing this code.  Sometimes its a controlled experience in a tool that authors code for the user (high level).  If you are reading this then it is likely an IDE where you are the author of the code like OSS-Code (VSCode), JupyterLab, Colab, PyCharm amongst many others.
