    "- Feature-Based Explainations\n",
    "    - How much did each feature contribute to a specific prediction\n",
    "    - Uses a baseline for comparison, usually based on the central value for each feature from the training data\n",
    "    - Helpful for recognizing bias and finding areas for improvement\n",
    "    - Read more about [feature attributions and methods](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/explainable-ai/overview#feature_attributions)\n",
    "- Example-Based Explainations\n",
    "    - Return similar examples, neighbors, to help understand predictions\n",
    "    - Along with prediction, get example from the source data that are most similar to the prediction to further understand \"why?\"\n",

You can also set, or override, the `explainationSpec` when deploying models to and endpoints or configuring batch predictions jobs.\n"
