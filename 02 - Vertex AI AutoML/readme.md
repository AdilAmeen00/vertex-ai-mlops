# 02 - Vertex AI AutoML
Accelerated ML with [Vertex AI AutoML](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/automl-model-types)

Vertex AI AutoML accelerate the workflow of creating an ML model by preprocessing the data and choosing model architectures for you, even testing multiple and creating ensembles to achieve a best model.  This is available for ML models on text, image, video, and tabular data.  

## This series of notebooks will introduce Vertex AI AutoML with a focus on Tabular data Classification Methods.
