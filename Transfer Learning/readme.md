This series focuses on using already trained models to create fit for purpose ML models.  This includes uptraining with new data to allow the weights to adjust as well as adding new layers to make use of the models - like classification.

This is divided into examples with [text](./text/readme.md) and [images](./image/readme.md) as subfolders here.
